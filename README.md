# My workstations config

Over the years, my (day job & personal) workstations have been setup based on 3 primary tools

1. Nix (package manager)
1. Neovim (coding editor)
1. Ghostty (terminal emulator)

Everything else kinda comes and goes, so changes are expected. I also prefer functionality & simplicity over look & feel, so there won't be anything fancy in my config. All of them are kept pretty minimal.

### Hosts

My main (favourite) host is NixOS. However, due to work requirements, I do use WSL2 on Windows & MacOS as well.
